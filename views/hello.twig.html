    Watson is here to help you monitoring your time. You want to know how much time you are spending on your projects? You want to generate a nice report for your client? Watson is here for you.

    Tell Watson when you start working on a task with the start command. Then, when you are done with this task, stop the timer with the stop command. This will create what we call a frame. That's pretty much everything you need to know to start using Watson. Each frame consists of the name of a project and some tags. Your tags can be shared across projects and can be used to generate detailed reports.

    Watson stores everything on your computer, but you can go wild and use artich.io to store your sessions remotely and share it with your colleagues.
